  Dialogue:
  - "You're lucky to be alive. I\u2019m Captain Reid. This world? It\u2019s not just
    chaos\u2014it\u2019s hell on Earth. Zombies are everywhere, and the city's in
    ruins."
  - "I\u2019ve seen enough to believe it. What do you need from me?"
  - "The train line\u2014it\u2019s our only shot at moving supplies and survivors.
    But it\u2019s down. I need someone to reconnect it. That\u2019s where you come
    in."
  - "I\u2019m no expert, but I can try. What\u2019s the issue?"
  - "Power\u2019s out, debris on the tracks, and the station\u2019s infested with
    the dead. Clear it out, get the power back, and get the trains running."
  - "How bad\u2019s the infestation?"
  - "Bad enough that no one else made it back. You\u2019ll have to be fast and careful."
  - "And if I don\u2019t make it?"
  - "Then we lose the last lifeline we\u2019ve got. But if you succeed, you save
    lives\u2014maybe even your own. So, you in?"
  optionText:
  - Sure
  - No
  - I'll think about it.
