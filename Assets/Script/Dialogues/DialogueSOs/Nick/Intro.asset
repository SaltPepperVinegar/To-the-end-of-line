  Dialogue:
  - "Hey, hold up. The next road\u2019s packed with zombies\u2014more than I\u2019ve
    seen in one place for days. It\u2019s a death trap if you go in guns blazing."
  - "Look, I\u2019ve got enough ammo and a good shot. I say we take them out, clear
    the path.\n\n"
  - "*shakes head* That\u2019ll just bring more. Noise attracts them, and they\u2019re
    already swarming. Fighting through could trap us both.\n\n"
  - Then what do you suggest? Just sitting here?
  - "Not sitting\u2014sneaking. We\u2019ve got stealth armor for a reason. We move
    quiet, stay low, and slip right through. No mess, no attention."
  optionText:
  - "Alright, alright. We go your way. But if anything goes wrong, we\u2019re fighting
    our way out."
  - "*shrugs, gripping your weapon* It\u2019s kept me alive so far. I know it won\u2019t
    let me down. "
