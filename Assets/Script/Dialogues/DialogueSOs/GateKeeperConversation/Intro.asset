  Dialogue:
  - "You got a death wish, stranger? Outside those walls, it's nothing but hell.
    Zombies, raiders, worse. You really think you\u2019re ready to face that?"
  - "I know exactly what\u2019s out there. But I don\u2019t have a choice. I\u2019ve
    got a mission."
  - You know how many people I've seen leave this place on some 'big mission'? Too
    many. And you know how many came back? Not one. You sure you want to be next?
  optionText:
  - "It\u2019s worth everything. "
